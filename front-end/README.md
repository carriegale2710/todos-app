# Todos App - Frontend UI

- This Todos App front end UI was made with React (Vite) + Typescript.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started: Frontend React App UI

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- The backend Spring Boot API running (see backend README for setup)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/carriegale2710/todos-app.git
cd todos-app/front-end
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Configure API Endpoint (if needed)

- By default, the frontend expects the backend API at `http://localhost:8080`.
- If your backend runs on a different port or host, update the API URLs in your frontend code (usually in a `services` or `config` file).

### 4. Run the Frontend App

```sh
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

- The app will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

### 5. Using the App

- Make sure your backend API is running and accessible.
- You can now add, edit, delete, and filter tasks and categories through the UI.
- Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or your browser‚Äôs dev tools to inspect API requests and responses.

---

**Troubleshooting:**

- If you see errors about failing to fetch data, ensure the backend API is running and CORS is configured if accessing from a different host/port.
- For port conflicts, change the frontend port in `package.json` or with the `PORT` environment variable.

---

You can now develop and test the React frontend with the Spring Boot backend :D
